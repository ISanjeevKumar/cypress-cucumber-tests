Challenges faced and resolutions:

`Step implementation missing for`

```The issue is with the folder structure and naming conventions. Below are the two main rules we need to follow```

```Folder name and Feature file name should be the same
Feature file and step definitions should not be in the same folder 
( stepdefinations/ .js file should always be in a folder which we have created earlier).```
